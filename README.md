# Fahrtenbuch (Driver's book)

I want a simple possibility to note my way with my car. I started to notice my driving
in a small booklet, but I thought of an app. So this is my first android app, a small
driver's book.

My simple thinking was: press a start button, everything is noticed automatically.
Press a stop button, everything is noticed automatically. For now it is not easy like
that, I only have to notice the start kilometer and the end kilometer before each
pressing of the button.

My aims for the future are, access the cars data automatically and access the electricity
meter automatically.

Here are some screenshots of the app:

<table>
<tr><td> Start screen with 'Start' and 'Stop' Button for your trip. Press 'Start' for recording.
</td><td> Press 'Stop' to stop Recording.
</td><td> Details of a trip.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="app/src/main/resources/FB-Start.png" width="20%" alt="Start screen">
</td><td><img src="app/src/main/resources/FB-Stop.png" width="20%" alt="Stop screen">
</td><td><img src="app/src/main/resources/FB-Menu.png" width="20%" alt="Menu">
</td></tr>

<tr><td> List of all trips and chargings.
</td><td> Details of a trip or charging.
</td><td> Map of your trip, GPS Data moved to OSMAnd.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="app/src/main/resources/FB-List.png" width="20%" alt="List Screen">
</td><td><img src="app/src/main/resources/FB-Detail.png" width="20%" alt="Detail Screen">
</td><td><img src="app/src/main/resources/FB-Map.png" width="20%" alt="Map App">
</td></tr>
</table>
